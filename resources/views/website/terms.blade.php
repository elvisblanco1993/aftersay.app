                these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, you are expressly prohibited from using the

            <h2>1. Eligibility and User Accounts</h2>
            <h3>1.1. <strong>Eligibility.</strong></h3>
            <p>The Service is intended for commercial use and is available only to businesses and sole proprietors. By
                using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into this
                agreement. You further agree that you are not a consumer and are using the Service for commercial
                purposes.</p>
            <h3>1.2. <strong>Account Information.</strong></h3>
            <p>To access the Service, you must create an account. During the account creation process, we will collect
                your name, email, business name, business address, business logo, business website address, business
                industry, and links to your existing review platforms. You agree to provide accurate, current, and
                complete information during registration and to maintain and promptly update this information.</p>
            <h3>1.3. <strong>Account Security.</strong></h3>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and are solely
                responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any
                unauthorized use of your account.</p>
            <h2>2. The Service and Acceptable Use</h2>
            <h3>2.1. <strong>Service Description.</strong></h3>
            <p>Aftersay provides a SaaS platform that automates the collection of client feedback and public reviews on
                various platforms, including but not limited to Google and Yelp, to help businesses manage and preserve
                their reputation.</p>
            <h3>2.2. <strong>Acceptable Use.</strong></h3>
            <p>You agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is unlawful, prohibited by these Terms, or for any
                other purpose not reasonably intended by Aftersay. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited
                to: harassment, spamming, collecting sensitive personal data without proper consent, using the Service
                for illegal activities, or engaging in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment
                of the Service.</p>
            <h2>3. Subscription, Billing, and Payments</h2>
            <h3>3.1. <strong>Subscription.</strong></h3>
            <p>The Service is offered on a monthly subscription basis. We may offer a free trial period without
                requiring a credit card.</p>
            <h3>3.2. <strong>Billing.</strong></h3>
            <p>By providing a payment method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly subscription fee. Your
                subscription will automatically renew each month unless you cancel it.</p>
            <h3>3.3. <strong>Refunds.</strong></h3>
            <p>We will refund your last monthly payment only. This policy is in place because usage is reset each month,
                and you have had access to the Service for that month's billing cycle.</p>
            <h3>3.4. <strong>Non-Payment.</strong></h3>
            <p>If a payment fails, your account's review collection and workflow automations will be paused. We will
                attempt to contact you to resolve the issue. If no response is received within three (3) months of our
                initial contact, your account will be deleted, and all associated data will be permanently removed.</p>
            <h2>4. Intellectual Property and User Content</h2>
            <h3>4.1. <strong>User Ownership.</strong></h3>
            <p>You retain full ownership of all feedback, reviews, client data, business logos, and any other content
                you upload to or collect through the Service ("Your Content"). Aftersay does not claim any ownership
                rights to Your Content.</p>
            <h3>4.2. <strong>Our License to You.</strong></h3>

                and use the Service for your commercial purposes.</p>
            <h3>4.3. <strong>Your License to Us.</strong></h3>

                displaying the reviews within your Aftersay dashboard.</p>
            <h3>4.4. <strong>User Responsibility for Data.</strong></h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for the legality of Your Content and for ensuring that you have the necessary
                rights, licenses, and consents from your clients to collect and use their feedback and data in
                compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Aftersay is not responsible for the data you upload
                or process through the Service.</p>
